I'm not a skydiver. I never got a license. It's been ten years since I did my fifteen jumps.

But those few weeks of ground school and instructed jumps, and those several thousand bucks, provided both professional and personal lessons that I've thought about nearly daily, and hopefully put to some use. I'll probably never jump again, but the effect on my life hsa been profound. 

##I learned to slow down

Skydiving is as safe as the equipment and the mindset of the jumper. New students memorize how to methodically check the equipment before boarding the plane. Checklists are known to improve certain detailed processes, such as [medical procedures](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19682451) and [aviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preflight_checklist).

Skydivers from around the world visit a dropzone and want to maximize the number of jumps they can achieve. This means land, run to the parachute packing area, quickly pack, and get back to the plane before it takes off again. But if you run to the plane, a safe dropzone shouldn't let you board. And for good reason. Incorrect equipment usage is a major cause of [skydiving fatalities](https://www.dropzone.com/fatalities/), including some things so basic as not inserting one's legs into the harness, or even [confusing video equipment for a parachute, multiple times](https://apnews.com/061807bba937de09d52077b194ee6f54).

> "The harness McGuire wore for the video equipment is similar to that of a parachute. It has the same feel."

*My lesson:* being methodical in preparation is a valuable skill. Using a checklist decreases the chances of missing something, and decreases the overall cognitive load for repetitive tasks.

##I learned to relax on-demand

At some point, every student has to make a solo jump. As soon as I exited the plane, my first subconscious reaction was to panic. My body went rigid instead of relaxed. I spun through the air and out of control. If you open your parachute with this type of movement, there's a good chance it gets twisted or tangled and you'll have a hard landing. Opening is better than not-opening, but opening dangerously when you are not stabilized can often lead to serious injury or death. In my first solo jump, there were 3 to 4 eternal seconds where I believed I was going to crash to the ground. That realization was like an electrocution, and my brain quickly took over from my flailing body. *What needs to be done?* Good body stabilization. *How does one achieve that?* The body must relax.

As soon as I remembered the lessons of ground school, of what I needed to do, I was able to convince my body to relax and I snapped into a safer, stabilized position. 

Here's the video of my first solo jump, for your entertainment:

*My lesson:* Try to regularly measure my "relaxation-status", and when not calm, don't do anything else except work on getting calm.

##I learned to know when to trust equipment

I was sitting around the dropzone, all geared-up and ready to board. Skydivers wear altimeters on their hand, to easily monitor the altitude during the jump. As I put my altimeter on my hand, it dropped from knee-hight to the ground. No big deal, right?

Wrong. An instructor happened to see the altimeter fall, and worse, he saw that I put it on for my next jump. He walked over to me, took my altimeter, and brought me another to use. His thinking, which was 100% correct. The altimeter only fell a short distance, but in the small chance that something internally did break, it could be the matter of life and death. He worse my altimeter in addition to his own, and confirmed after his jump that it indeed was working correctly.

*My lesson:* Know when to **not** trust the equipment.


##I learned to know when to wait

The "stress" of skydiving causes a hormone response, specifically cortisol:

> Higher post-jump happiness predicted faster cortisol recovery after jumping...

And it's not even just beginners: 

> Intriguingly, even after hundreds of prior exposures, the experienced jumpers still showed a significant cortisol response to the jump...

After my AFF (advanced free-fall) course was complete, I was on my flight back home from the dropzone in Spain. The feeling


*My lesson:* Waiting is also OK. Don't feel pressured to act. It's better to wait until all the information is known, or in this case, until the hormonal response has worn off.

And whenever old memories come back, of sweating as I sat, packed liked sardines, in a roaring, climbing plane. And the burst of cold air when the plane door was slid open. And watching one-by-one the experienced skydivers fall out of the plane, waiting for my turn at the end with the novices. My stomach still goes into knots, like it's again my turn to go.

Skydiving has gotten a lot safer. In 2018, there were 13 fatalities for an estimate 3.3 million jumps. And according to the US Parachute Association:

> Tandem skydiving has an even better safety record, with one student fatality per 500,000 tandem jumps over the past decade.
